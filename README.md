# MaxEnt Modeling and Regularization

## Description
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model, applied for probabilistic modeling of species presence within a given landscape. The project emphasizes regularization and logistic interpretation of MaxEnt results.

## Key Concepts
- **MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy)**: Estimation of species presence probability based on environmental predictors.
- **Regularization**: Techniques employed to avoid overfitting by introducing penalty terms for model complexity.
- **Logistic Output**: Interpretation of the MaxEnt model results into probabilities.
